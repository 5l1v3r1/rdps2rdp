Quick POC to MITM RDP SSL - http://diablohorn.wordpress.com
Inspired by: https://labs.portcullis.co.uk/blog/ssl-man-in-the-middle-attacks-on-rdp/

When a client connects it will be presented with a fake cert and all the plain text data
will be saved to a pcap. You can then use the pcap to extract key strokes or to replay the
session if you have the appropiate tools for it.
